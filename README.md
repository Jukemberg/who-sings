WhoSings is an iOS GameApp created for the Musixmatch iOS Test 

## Installation
The only requirement to install the app is to use CocoaPods to install the 3 libraries I used.

```
pod install
```

## Libraries

For this project I wanted to keep the usage of libraries as low as possible so I chosen the 3 most useful ones for me:

### Alamofire

Alamofire is my favourite HTTP networking library you can check it here: https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire

### ObjectMapper

ObjectMapper is a useful tool for mapping JSON objects fast and easy: https://github.com/tristanhimmelman/ObjectMapper

### Realm

Realm allow to manage and store data on the fly like no other: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa

## Style, Icons & Logos

The simple style of the app was made with Sketch and iOS standards.
The 2 icons used in the app are from:
- [user.pdf](https://github.com/Jukemberg/who-sings/files/6278052/user.pdf) Icon made by PixelPerfect from www.flaticon.com
- [MXM-Mark.pdf](https://github.com/Jukemberg/who-sings/files/6278062/MXM-Mark.pdf) Logo mark of Musixmatch from https://about.musixmatch.com/brand-resources

App logo is born from an idea at the end of the project I hope you'll like it!
